Description: Implementation of  advanced datastructures such as hashmaps,
    heaps, or queues . Advanced datastructures are essential
    in many computer science and statistics problems such as for graph
    algorithms or string analysis. datastructures use Boost and Rcpp modules
    and wrap these as C++ objects for R usage.
